2005-10-05  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@nokia.com>

	* src/ke-recv.c (sig_handler): Only react to the full
	MMC_DEVICE_OP path, not also when it is a prefix.

2005-10-04  Marius Vollmer  <marius.vollmer@nokia.com>

	* src/events.c (mmc_device_file): Removed, this value is only
	stored in an envvar now.
	(handle_e_startup): Don't initialize it.
	(handle_e_rename, format_and_mount): Don't use mmc_device_file,
	use the envvar.
	
	* src/ke-recv.h (MMC_DEVICE_FILE_DEFAULT): Removed, there is no
	default any more.
	(MMC_DEVICE_FILE_WITH_PARTITION,
	MMC_DEVICE_FILE_WITHOUT_PARTITION): New, run_mount will try both.
	(MMC_DEVICE_OP): Removed partition part.
	(MMC_SYSFS_FILE): Likewise.
	
	* src/exec-func.c (try_mount): Renamed from run_mount, made static
	and changed to take the device file as an argument.
	(run_mount): Call try_mount with MMC_DEVICE_FILE_WITHOUT_PARTITION
	and the with MMC_DEVICE_FILE_WITH_PARTITION until it succeeds.

	* src/mmc-format.c (start_format): Fail when envvar
	MMC_DEVICE_FILE is not defined.

	* src/osso-mmc-mount.sh: Do not pass our own arguments to mount.
	Explicitely pass type, options and $MMC_DEVICE_FILE.  This allows
	this script to mount different device files.

	* src/osso-update-mmc-label.sh: Also clear /tmp/.mmc-volume-label
	when mmc-rename failed.
